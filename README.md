## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE
3. Run the `LLDRunner.java` file which contains the main method
4. Each system's demo can also be run individually by executing their respective demo classes

## Project Structure

- Each system has its own directory (e.g., `AirlineManagementSystem/`)
- Inside each directory:
  - Demo class (e.g., `AirlineManagementSystemDemo.java`)
  - Additional implementation files specific to that system
- All demos implement a static `run()` method
- `LLDRunner.java` serves as the main entry point to run all demos

## Contributing

Feel free to add more design examples or improve existing ones:
1. Create a new demo class following the existing pattern
2. Add your demo's `run()` method call in `LLDRunner.java`
3. Submit a pull request
